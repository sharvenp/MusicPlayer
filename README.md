Tunez is a simple Music Media Player. It can play `.mp3` and `.wav` files and supports all media commands such as play, pause, skip, seek, etc.

Also displays a audio spectrum visualizer along with any metadata found in the music files such as album, artist, title, and album art.

*Note there is no executable for this application yet and it will be available in a later release.*
